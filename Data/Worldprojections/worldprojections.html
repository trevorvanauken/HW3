    <h2>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h2>
    
    <h3>Describe in your own words how you displayed the map in different projections using QGIS</h3>
    <p>To display the map in different projections, I clicked on the bottom right where it allows you to select different CRSs.
    I then selected the various different projections needed plus 2 others. To see how the projections changed area, shape, etc,
     I used the indacatrix mapper to add circles/ ovals to see distortion. To export my projections, I used the QGIS layout manager
    to convert them into PNGs and to add labels.</p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This map uses a coordinate system on the surface of an ellipsoid of reference. It conserves direction, which makes it
        good for directions. This map reminds me of a mercator, but with some vertical squishing at the poles.
    </h3>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection appears to be a modified azimuthal projection, which means a spherical surface was projected onto a plane
        and then modified. In this map, all factors appear to be somewhat distorted. When researching, I found that this map can be
        appropriate for small scale mapping of the world.

    <h2>Pseudo-Mercator</h2>
    <h3>The pseudo-mercator is a cylindrical projection. Since the mercator is a conformal map projection, directions and shapes
        are maintained. However, area, especially around the poles, is very distorted. Both latitude and longitude lines are straight.

    <h2>Sphere Winkel</h2>
    <h3>This map is spherical, with bulging at the equator. It does not appear to be conformal or equal-area, so it somewhat distorts
        all factors. This map has flat horizontal lines and increasingly curvy longitude lines as you reach the sides.

    <h2>Cylindrical Equal Area</h2>
    <h3>This map is cylindrical, which means a cylinder is put around the globe then projected. As it says in the name, this map maintains
        the area of all locations. This comes at the expense of shape and distance, especially at the poles.

    <h2>World Equidistant Conic</h2>
    <h3>This is a conic map, which is created by laying a cone over the globe then projecting. This particular map is centered over the north pole.
        This map maintains distance at the expense of shape, direction, and area. This map is good at showing how close countries are to each other, especially
        at the point where the map is centered, in this case the north pole. It is important how much of the cone is done, since it can be much narrower than this map. 
        Still, this one shows the USA and Russia much more separated than an azimuthal map like the next.

    <h2>North Azimuthal Equidistant</h2>
    <h3>While also centered around the north pole and maintaining distance, this map is different than the one above because it is an azimuthal, which means
        surface area is projected onto a plane. This azimuthal maintains the far-side distance better than the conic projection.

    <h2>World Eckert 2</h2>
    <h3>This map has an odd shape, with extra stretching around the far sides near the equator. It is equidistant, so it distorts shapes, directions, and distances.
        It appears to have little distortion around the center with lots around the sides and a moderate amount near the poles.

    <h2>World Robinson</h2>
    <h3>This map shows flat horizontal lines and increasingly curvy longitude lines as you reach the sides. It appears to be similar to a cylindriacl projection,
        with some changes. This map does not maintain any of the factors, but it looks very nice and easy to read.
